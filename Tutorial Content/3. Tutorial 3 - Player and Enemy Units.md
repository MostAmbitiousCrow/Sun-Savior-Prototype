# Player Turret Unit Setup:
## Finding the Pre-made Player Unit Prefabs:

In the '**Tutorial Assets**' prefabs folder, inside the '**Player Units**' folder should be two Player Unit Prefabs. In this tutorial, we're going to script the Player Turret to shoot at incoming enemies and provide the Turret and the Wall unit a Health system.

<img width="501" alt="Player Units Prefab Folder 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a37f2d63-c356-49e5-9942-9ad65d2c0d44" />

Double click the '**Player Turret**' prefab to open it. The Objects should be already there for you.

# Player Unit AI:

Let's start by adding our stats variables. These will be variables that will allow us to control the fire rate, turn speed, damage, range of detection, determine what layers of collision the turret can shoot at (In this case, enemies) and determine if the turret is attacking.
```cs
[Header("Stats")]
[SerializeField] private float fireRate = 1; // Time each projectile is fired
[SerializeField] private float turnSpeed = 1; // Speed in which the turret rotates towards an enemy
[SerializeField] private float damage = 1; // Damage the turret deals to an enemy
[SerializeField] private float detectionRadius = 6; // Sphere radius where the turret will detect enemy units
[SerializeField] private LayerMask enemyLayer; // Enemy collision layer the turret will detect
[SerializeField] private bool attacking; // Determines if the turret is attacking
private bool canshoot; // Determine if the turrets laser can shoot, as to prevent overlapping
```

These will be the Turrets Components. A transform where the laser projectile will emit from, the turrets body (aka the mesh) and the Line Renderer from the 'Projectile Spawn' Object.
```cs
[Header("Components")]
[SerializeField] Rigidbody rb; // Roots rigidbody
[SerializeField] Transform projectileSpawn; // Start location where the projectile will emit (the gun)
[SerializeField] Transform body; // The turrets body in which the turret will rotate
[SerializeField] LineRenderer lineRenderer; // Line Renderer component (The Laser)
```

And these will be the variables for storing information about the the enemy targets the turret has such as its currently targeted enemy, a list of all the targets in its detection zone, its turret state (that uses an enum variable) and a target count that will store the amount of targets in range.
```cs
[Header("Target Info")]
[SerializeField] Transform currentTarget; // Current target in which the turret is firing at
[SerializeField] Collider[] detectedTargets; // List of detected targets in detection radius

public enum TurretState { First, Last, Closest }
[SerializeField] TurretState turretState = TurretState.First; // turrets current state

private Coroutine routine; // Stored Coroutine
[SerializeField] int targetCount = 0; // Count of the list of detected targets
```

> [!TIP]
> An enumeration, also known as '**enum**', are a unique data type that contains a set of possible, pre-defined, values that are easy to read and understand.
> 
> You can use these to create information such as movement states (Walking, running, sneaking), difficulties (easy, medium, hard etc) and more! 
## Turret States

Firstly, create a new public function named **UpdateState** and assign it a TurretState argument. Our aim here is to to create an event to easily change the way the turret targets its enemy targets.
```cs
public void UpdateState(TurretState state)
{
	if (state == turretState) return;
	turretState = state;
}
```

## Picking a Target, Based on the Current State:

Based on our three states, each state is going to target an enemy based on certain conditions. In this tutorial, we're going to do three states: First (selecting the first enemy that comes into range), Last (selecting the last enemy that is in range) and Closest (selecting the closest enemy in range, based off the distance from it to the turret).

We can get the first target by simply acquiring the first target in the '**detectedTargets**' list. and the last by counting the target count and subtracting it by one. The list is going to be order based on what order a targeted entered the turrets detection range first.
```cs
void GetTarget()
{
	switch (turretState)
	{
		case TurretState.First:
		currentTarget = detectedTargets[0].transform;
		break;
		case TurretState.Last:
		currentTarget = detectedTargets[targetCount - 1].transform;
		break;
		case TurretState.Closest:
		currentTarget = FindClosestTarget();
		break;
	}
}
```

As for finding the closest target, we'll have to create a separate function to return the Transform component of the closest enemy. To do this, we're going to go through the list of detected targets, and calculate and compare the closest targets distance from the turrets position to find the target with the shortest distance, thus defining the closest target.
```cs
Transform FindClosestTarget() // Find closest enemy in list
{
	float minDist = Mathf.Infinity;
	Vector3 pos = transform.position;
	
	Transform target = null;
	foreach (var item in detectedTargets)
	{
		Transform itemT = item.transform;
		float dist = Vector3.Distance(pos, itemT.position);
		if (dist < minDist)
		{
			minDist = dist;
			target = itemT;
		}
	}
	Debug.Log(gameObject.name + "'s Nearest Target is " + target.name);
	return target;
}
```
## Detecting Enemies

Before we can test if our states work, we'll need to draw a collider around the turret to detect enemies.

Typically, you could use a collider, however, for this tutorial we're going to approach this using **Physics.OverlapSphere**. This is mainly to boost performance as Overlap won't check for any  physics interactions like collisions or triggers.
```cs
void DetectEnemies()
{
	detectedTargets = Physics.OverlapSphere(transform.position, detectionRadius, enemyLayer);
	targetCount = detectedTargets.Length;
	if (targetCount != 0 && !attacking)
	{
		attacking = true;
		BeginFiring(); // Begin firing
	}
	else if (targetCount == 0)
	{
		attacking = false;
		if (routine != null) StopCoroutine(routine); // Stop firing
	}
}
```
> [!TIP] 
> If you're ever unsure whether or not to use Overlap checks in your projects; here's a simple breakdown of comparisons between using Overlap and colliders:
> 
>| **Feature**              | Physics.Overlap...                       | **Sphere Collider**                             |
>| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
>| **Dynamic checks**       | Ideal for on-demand, momentary queries.  | Requires enabling/disabling collider as needed. |
>| **Physics interactions** | No collision or trigger events.          | Triggers collision and trigger events.          |
>| **Performance**          | Lightweight for one-time checks.         | Slightly heavier due to simulation overhead.    |
>| **Ease of use**          | Code-only, no GameObject setup required. | Requires setup and management in the scene.     |
If you check in play mode, you'll notice the Sphere won't be visible. This is because it won't typically appear in the Scene View or the Game. We'll have to use **Gizmos** to visualise it for us:

```cs
void OnDrawGizmos()
{
	Gizmos.color = Color.green;
	Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(transform.position, detectionRadius);
}
```

<img width="611" alt="Player Turret WireSphere Gizmos" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9caed8-cb83-42b0-b088-69320b754596" />

> [!TIP]
> Use '**OnGizmosDraw()**' if you want to always draw a gizmos. So in this case, the sphere will also appear in the scene view. And use '**OnGizmosDrawSelected**' if you want to only draw a gizmos once the object has been selected.

Add this function to your **Update()** function.
```cs
void Update() => DetectEnemies();
```
> [!TIP]
> Whenever you have a function that simple does one thing, you can add a **=>** at the end of the function. So, for example, you can use this in your update function only trigger the **DetectEnemies()** function, since this will be the only thing being triggered.
> This (=>) is know as an *Expression*.
# Character Health:

Now, before we can get the turret to begin shooting any targets, we need a way to store their health values and a way to heal and damage it, and eventually destroying the character.

Here, we'll create a new script and call it **'Character_Health_Script'**, which we'll assign to our player units.
This script will contain variables to store the characters max health, current health (Health), a unity event in case we want to trigger an event, and two simple public functions to allow us to damage and heal the character.
```cs
[Header("Health Variables")]
public float maxHealth = 5;
public float health = 0;
public UnityEvent triggerEvent; // New

void Start() => health = maxHealth;

public void Damage(float damage)
{
	health -= damage;
	if (health < 0) // If health is depleted, trigger the event and destroy
	{
		triggerEvent.Invoke(); // New
		Destroy(gameObject);
	}
}

public void Heal(float heal) => health += heal;
```
You can add this script to the root object of your Player Turret, the Player Wall Prefab, Enemy Prefab and Tower GameObject in the scene.

## Facing and Shooting Targets

As part of this tutorial, the player turret will fire lasers at its target, provided visually using the Line Renderer component. This process will take place in a coroutine.
In the coroutine, we'll first acquire the target by calling the '**GetTarget()**' function, its '**Character_Health_Script**' component and then store the turrets current position and rotation.

Using a '**While**' loop, we're going to rotate the turret to face towards its target. The loop will end once the turret has no enemies in range.
```cs
private IEnumerator FiringRoutine() // Where the action takes place
{
	GetTarget();
	float t = 0;
	Vector3 pos = transform.position;
	Quaternion rot = Quaternion.identity;
	Character_Health_Script eHP = currentTarget.GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>();
	Transform prevTarget = currentTarget;
	
	while (attacking)
	{
		GetTarget();
		
		float yRot = Quaternion.LookRotation(currentTarget.position - pos).eulerAngles.y;
		rot = Quaternion.RotateTowards(body.rotation, Quaternion.Euler(0, yRot, 0), turnSpeed);
		body.rotation = rot;
```

Now, to get the turret to fire at the enemy over a constant sequence of time we need to utilise **Time.deltaTime** to count upwards, then check if that time value has reached over fire rate value; thus triggering the projectile sequence.

Once the timer has reached its specified amount, we're going to reset the timer, update the positions of the line renderer to end at the target, damage the target and then play the laser animation, via a coroutine.
```cs
		t += Time.deltaTime;
		if (t > fireRate)
		{
			t = 0;
			if (prevTarget != currentTarget)
			{
				prevTarget = currentTarget;
				eHP = currentTarget.GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>();
			} 
```

```cs
			lineRenderer.SetPosition(0, projectileSpawn.position);
			lineRenderer.SetPosition(1, new(currentTarget.position.x, projectileSpawn.position.y, currentTarget.position.z));
```

```cs
			eHP.Damage(damage);
			StartCoroutine(LaserAnimation());
		}
		yield return null;
	}
	yield break;
}
```

In our **LaserAnimation()** we'll calculate how fast the Liner Renderer component should be active by multiplying the fire rate by 0.1, and clamping as to avoid any overlapping.
```cs
IEnumerator LaserAnimationRoutine()
{
	lineRenderer.enabled = true;
	yield return new WaitForSeconds(Mathf.Clamp(.1f * fireRate, .01f, .1f));
	lineRenderer.enabled = false;
	canshoot = false;
	yield break;
}
```

Before we can properly test this, we need to create an enemy unit for the turret to shoot at.
# Enemy Unit:

Open the Enemy Prefab in your Prefabs folder and create a new script named Enemy_AI, and add it to the Enemy root GameObject.

Here, we'll add the enemy stat variables such as how fast it will move, how much damage it will deal and the attack rate over time, what layer it should use to detect player units and an enum to represent what state it's in.
```cs
[Header("Enemy Variables")]
[SerializeField] private float speed;
[SerializeField] private float damage = 1;
[SerializeField] private float attackRate = .5f;
private Quaternion direction;
private bool attacking;
[SerializeField] private LayerMask unitLayer;
[SerializeField]
enum EnemyState { Moving, Attacking }
[SerializeField] EnemyState state = EnemyState.Moving;
```

Here, we'll add three detection variables, one to determine how large the attack box should be (we'll default this by 1x, 1y, 1z but you can change this to 1x, 2y, 1z to make the hitbox taller), and a list of target colliders the attack box will detect and store.
```cs
[Header("Detection Variables")]
[SerializeField] Vector3 attackBoxSize = new(1,1,1);
[SerializeField] Collider[] hitColliders;
[SerializeField] int prevLength = 0;
```

Here we'll store the enemy object components.
```cs
[Header("Components")]
[SerializeField] private Rigidbody rb;
[SerializeField] private Transform detectBoxPos;
[SerializeField] private Character_Health_Script hpScript;

// public Wave_Manager waveManager; // REMOVE

public Transform tower;

Coroutine routine;
```

In our start function, we'll firstly assign the tower variable, this is what the enemy is going to move towards and attack. Then, we can change its look direction to look directly towards the tower once it's created and set its movement velocity.
```cs
void Start()
{
tower = GameObject.FindWithTag("Tower").transform;
direction = Quaternion.LookRotation(tower.position - transform.position);
transform.rotation = direction;
rb.velocity = transform.forward * speed;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to note that, when using Quaternion.LookRotation, if you want an object to face another object, subtracting object A's position from object B's position will make object B face towards object A, that is if the rotation is applied to object B. Doing this in reverse will make object B face away from Object A.
## Moving Towards the Tower:

In a '**FixedUpdate()**' function, trigger a new function named '**AttackBoxDetect()**' and another function named '**Moving()**' that can only be triggered if the '**attacking**' boolean is false.
```cs
private void FixedUpdate()
{
	AttackBoxDetect();
	if (!attacking) Moving();
}
```

And in the '**Moving()**' function, we'll simply add forward velocity to make the enemy move forwards.
```cs
void Moving() => rb.velocity = transform.forward * speed;
```

## Attacking Player Units:

As done for the Player Unit detection zone, in our new '**AttackBoxDetect()**' function we're going to use **Physics.OverlapBox** to create an invisible cube to detect player units. 
```cs
void AttackBoxDetect()
{
	hitColliders = Physics.OverlapBox(detectBoxPos.position, attackBoxSize / 2, detectBoxPos.rotation, unitLayer);
	int length = hitColliders.Length;
	if (length == 0)
	{
		state = EnemyState.Moving;
		attacking = false;
		prevLength = 0;
		if (routine != null) StopCoroutine(routine);
	}
	else if (length != prevLength)
	{
		state = EnemyState.Attacking;
		prevLength = length;
		attacking = true;
		rb.velocity = new();
		routine = StartCoroutine(Attack());
	}
}
```

We can these use Gizmos to visualise the detection box in front of the. However, it's worth noting that DrawWire won't allow us to rotate the wire. Instead, we'll have to set the set the detect box's local position to World Matrix using **Gizmos.matrix**. Gizmos.matrix is the position, rotation and scale of the Gizmos.
```cs
void OnDrawGizmos()
{
	Gizmos.matrix = detectBoxPos.localToWorldMatrix;
	Gizmos.color = Color.red;
	//Gizmo draw a cube where the OverlapBox is (positioned where your GameObject is as well as the given size)
	Gizmos.DrawWireCube(Vector3.zero, attackBoxSize);
}
```

In our attack coroutine, we'll add a simple attack timer that will attack every enemy detected by its hitbox over a set . It will stop attacking 
```cs
IEnumerator Attack()
{
	List<Character_Health_Script> HSs = new();
	foreach (var item in hitColliders) HSs.Add(item.GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>());
	
	while (attacking)
	{
		yield return new WaitForSeconds(attackRate);
		foreach (var item in HSs)
		{
			if (item != null)
			{
				item.Damage(damage);
				// Debug.Log(gameObject.name + " Damaged " + item.name);
			}
		}
	}
	yield break;
}
```

Alternatively, if you wanted the enemy to just attack one target at a time, we can rework the script to do so by remove

```cs
IEnumerator Attack()
{
	Character_Health_Script HS = hitColliders[0].GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>();
	
	while (attacking)
	{
		yield return new WaitForSeconds(attackRate);
		if (HS != null) HS.Damage(damage);
	}
	yield break;
}
```

But what if we wanted some enemies to be able to attack multiple targets, and some to only attack single targets?

Well, first we need to do an if statement to provide the correct variables to the necessary variable (List of Health Scripts for if the enemy can attack groups, and a single Health Script if the enemy can't attack groups).
```cs
IEnumerator Attack()
{
	List<Character_Health_Script> HSs = null;
	Character_Health_Script HS = null;
	  
	// Select variable based on attack mode
	if (canAttackGroups)
	{
		HSs = new List<Character_Health_Script>();
		foreach (var item in hitColliders)
		{
			var healthScript = item.GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>();
			if (healthScript != null) HSs.Add(healthScript); // Cache non-null scripts
		}
	}
	else
	{
		HS = hitColliders[0]?.GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>();
	}
```
> [!TIP]
> The '**?**' in `HS = hitColliders[0]?.GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>();` is the **null conditional operator** in C#. It's a really quick and great way of checking if the object before the operator is `null` before attempting to access it.
> 
> So, If `hitColliders[0]` is `null`, the `?.` operator prevents the call to `GetComponent<Character_Health_Script>()`. And if it isn't `null` then `hitColliders[0]` is valid, and contains the `Character_Health_Script` component, `HS` is assigned the reference to that component.


Now that we've established the variables, we just need to trigger the attack loop based on if the enemy can attack groups or not.
```cs
// Start attack loop based on attack mode
	if (canAttackGroups)
	{
		while (attacking)
		{
			yield return new WaitForSeconds(attackRate);
			foreach (var item in HSs)
			{
				item.Damage(damage);
			}
		}
	}
	else
	{
		while (attacking && HS != null)
		{
			yield return new WaitForSeconds(attackRate);
			HS.Damage(damage);
		}
	}
}
```

If you've added added the '**Character_Health_Script**' script to the enemy, spawn them into the scene by dragging their prefabs from the project folder to the scene and test out if the enemies move towards the tower, get targeted by player turrets and get destroyed.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ad7ee5-0196-4ea4-996c-804c1bbfbb40

And your enemies should also be able to attack and destroy its targets.
