# Sun-Savior-Prototype Journal
 
# Week 1:

I spent this week planning my Games Programming project. To do this, I created a Miro Board and constructed a Mind Map of the contents of the prototype. (Miro Board)

I wanted to aim for something that aimed for something visually technical while also delivering unique gameplay. (Aim For the Project)

So, I had the idea of a 3D tower defence game where you’re only able to build wherever there is light. This would utilise Unity’s lighting system and could also give the project a nice atmosphere if done correctly. (Prototype Concept)

However, one concern I had was to do with the assets that could be required to make this prototype work visually.
That and I didn’t have too much experience working with 3D lighting in Unity before, so much research would be required. (Concern With the Prototype)

I’d also have to limit the design of the enemy units and player units since getting the fundamentals down could be costly of my time. (Second Concern: Time)


# Week 2:

This week, I setup my initial GitHub repository. I added a newly built Unity Project under the version 2022.3.46f1 and used the Universal 3D Render Pipeline Template since it offers the best optimised graphics across different platforms. (Choosing my Template)
